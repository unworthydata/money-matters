I have 3 datasets:

- ILO_dataset.csv
- GBD_dataset.csv
- Population.csv

1) The ILO_dataset.csv contains unemployment data. It has a lot of columns, but we want to keep the following: "Country Name" (for example "United States of America"), "Country Code" (for example "ARE", "AFG"), and then columns for each year ("1991", "1992", all the way to "2019"). Each year column contains the unemployment data for that country for that year.

2) The GBD dataset contains mental disorder data. It has a lot of columns, but we want to keep the following: "location", "year", and "val" ("location" is the name of each country, for example: "United States of America", "val" column has the value to be measured, "year" is the year in which val was measured, this ranges from 1990 to 2019).

3) The Population.csv dataset contains population data. It has a lot of columns, but we want to keep the following: "Country Name" (for example "United States of America"), "Country Code" (for example "ARE", "AFG"), and then columns for each year ("1991", "1992", all the way to "2019"). Each year column contains the population for that country for that year.

I need you to write R code that does the following:

- Import GBD_dataset.csv, drop all columns in GBD, only keep "location", "year", and "val"
- mutate the GBD dataset to make each year present in the "year" column into its own column, with the matching values from "val"
- Import ILO_dataset.csv, drop all columns but keep the following: "Country Name", "Country Code", and then columns "1991" to "2019"
- import the Population.csv dataset, drop all columns but keep the following: "Country Name", "Country Code", and then columns "1991" to "2019"

- ILO_dataset.csv and Population.csv datasets contain ISO3C country codes, but the GBD dataset contains country names, I need you to convert the country names in GBD to ISO3C country codes using the countrycodes library, and then match up the data in all tables to create a scatter plot over the years 1991 - 2019. Any country codes that don't match up should be dropped. Use plotly.

The scatter point size will be the country's popluation, the color will be randomly determined by country, and have a play button with an animation to show changes over the years.
